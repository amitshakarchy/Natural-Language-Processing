This repository contains the tasks completed as part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev

---

[Assignment 1](Assignments/Assignment_1) - Text Preprocessing, Language Modeling and Generation - Implement a Markovian language model and a language generator.

[Assignment 2](Assignments/Assignment_2) - Contextual Spell Checking - The Noisy Channel and a Probabilistic Spell Checker. In this assignment we built a spell checker that handles both non-word and real-word errors given in a sentential context. In order to do that we learn a language model as well as reconstruct the error distribution tables (according to error type) from lists of common errors. Finally, we combine it all to a context sensitive noisy channel model.

[Assignment 3](Assignments/Assignment_3) - Authorship Attribution - LSTM networks - Using various algorithms for text classification, performing an authorship attribution task on Donald Trump’s tweets.
