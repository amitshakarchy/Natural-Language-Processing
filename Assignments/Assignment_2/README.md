# The Noisy Channel and a Probabilistic Spell Checker

In this assignment, we built a spell checker that handles both non-word and real-word errors given in a sentential context. 
To do so, we created a language model as well as reconstruct the error distribution tables (according to error type) from lists of common errors. 
Finally, we combined it all to a context sensitive noisy channel model.
